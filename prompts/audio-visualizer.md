Develop a comprehensive audio visualization project that analyzes and visually represents audio input in real-time. The project should include:

1. Audio input capture functionality using the Web Audio API or similar technology

2. Frequency analysis using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to process audio data

3. Multiple visualization modes (waveform, frequency bars, spectrum analyzer, particle effects)

4. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

5. Interactive controls for:

- Audio source selection (microphone/file upload)

- Visualization type selection

- Color scheme customization

- Sensitivity/scale adjustments

The implementation should:

- Use efficient rendering techniques (WebGL preferred for complex visualizations)

- Include proper error handling for audio device access

- Maintain smooth performance (target 60fps)

- Follow modern web development best practices

- Include comprehensive documentation for setup and customization

Testing requirements:

- Verify cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

- Test with various audio sources and quality levels

- Validate performance metrics under different system loads

- Ensure accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
